  <h3>In-Class Questions</h3>
  <br></br>
  <p>Q1. When you think of the term 'upgrade', do you think more of your own brain being enhanced or more of your body? Which do you think you are more likely to be personally invested in, given the money and risks involved?

    <br></br>
    Having family members who have gone through different surgeries to improve the quality of their life, I lean more towards upgrading parts of my body that needs to be repaired. My uncle had his knee repaired a few years ago and he told me that
    he's walking more confidently now. Personally, I would like to invest in a body enhancement because I am feeling the wear and tear in my body having worked in the construction business for many years. I feel like my shoulders sustained nerve
    damages that caused chronic pains, and I would like to have repairs that would fix this problem.</br>

    <br></br>

    Q2. Regarding the idea of enhancing technology that will be directly placed 'onto' or 'into' ourselves, what do you see as the direction(s) humans are going to evolve in the future. What do you think will be the factors and mechanisms that drive
    this?</br> <br>
    I think it’s inevitable that technology inside our body will be the new norm. Many people argue that it will make our lives more convenient because we won't have to carry our phone, wallet, identity, and it will be all in one place—a microchip
    implanted in us. As we discussed in our group, Apple has increased activity tracking in their latest iPhone updates. Although our smartphones are not inside our body, carrying them all the time is the closest thing to it being implanted.</br>

    <br></br>

    Q3. Would you prefer for technology to become more visible or invisible in our everyday experience? Should all of this technology be embedded in ourselves and our environment (invisible), or would you prefer to see it, to touch it, for it to
    be more a part from you and more in our faces (visible)?</br> <br>
    I prefer technology to be visible because corpora and powerful organizations subtly use invisibility and discreetness to their advantage. Many people are discriminated against by the government’s use of artificial intelligence. ACLU has long
    argued that some of these machines are ineffective when recognizing people of color. For this reason, I prefer that the government, private companies, and people of power are transparent with their use of technology in our everyday lives.
