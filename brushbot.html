  <h3>Phase 1 -- Brushbot</h3>
  <br></br>
  <p>Artist Statement</p>
  <br></br>
  <p>This was my first time creating an object with electronics. I've also never soldered anything before this class<br>so putting something together as we did with this object is an exciting experience for me. <br>
  Seeing it move around is very fulfilling. It made me feel like I have an electronic pet.  </p>

  <h3>LED Wearable (version 1)</h3>
  <br></br>
  <p>Artist Statement</p>
  <p>My idea for this project is to put led lights to my bike helmet to hopefully add more safety to my bike ride, especially when I'm riding in the dark.
    <br> I placed it on my right handle. For additional safety, when I press on the brakes, the helmet lights will be activated.
    <br>This project was more technical compared to the brushbot. I faced different challenges such as connectivity issues.
    <br> After I presented my working project in class, a couple of lights went out and I had to figure out what was wrong with it.
    <br> I ended up changing and resoldering the parts because I wasn't sure if the led died, or if the wires that weren't supposed to touch were touching.
    <br> I couldn't figure out what was wrong with it. I just redid everything and somehow it worked. </p>
