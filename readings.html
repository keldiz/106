  <h3>Reading Assignment #1 </h3>
  <p>Chapter 1</p>
  <p>1. Summarize the distinction(s) from the traditional Klines & Clines definition of the cyborg vs. the one that Clark is proposing as the main thesis of his book</p>

<ul>Clark suggests we are natural-born cyborgs and we don’t need to have characteristics of a machine to be categorized as one, as we can have machines as an annex to our physical bodies. For example, our iPhones track a lot of our activities such as steps taken, screen time, location, etc. In addition, we have grown accustomed to using our smartphones to help us with our businesses. Technology doesn’t necessarily have to be implanted in our skin to be considered cyborgs.
In contrast, Cline and Kline’s definition of a cyborg is an extension of humans and a cyborgs are   machines and humans merging together as one.</ul>
<br></br>

  <p>2. From The book, "Cyberneticists were especially interested in self-regulating systems." What are 2 or more examples of these, make sure to include both biological systems and also non-biological systems.
</p>
<ul>An example of a biological system in the human body system where every part has a role and x purpose. An example of a non-biological system is a computer where it uses programs to be able to operate.
</ul>

<br></br>

  <p>3. What other kinds of definitions of hybrid humans are there that are not based on definitions above but popular in literature, media culture, etc.: Dr. Octopus from the Spiderman.
</p>

<ul>Dr. Octopus from the movie Spiderman.</ul>

<br></br>

  <p>Chapter 2</p>


<p>1. Summarize a definition as described in the book of what the significant attributes  are for 'opaque' technology vs.   'transparent' technology.</p>

<ul>“Transparent” technology is the type of technology that is so coherent in our lives and seem like a second nature for us to use that it almost blends seamlessly in our lifestyles. “Opaque” technology has a learning curve and requires skill which makes the particular technology to appear more obvious.
</ul>
  <br></br>

  <p>2. Give some examples of technology that might be better served if it were more transparent and and also give some example of a technology that should be more opaque.
</p>

  <ul>An example of a “transparent” technology is driving a car. Some example of an “opaque” technology is using an Instant Pot, high end coffee machine, or an expensive bidet.
</ul>
    <br></br>

    <p>3.Does the watch and dictionary example discussed in the book, seem valid to you? Why?</p>

    <ul>Yes. Telling time through a watch is more accessible because it is more visible as supposed to searching for an unfamiliar word in a dictionary; either from a physical book or an application. </p>
</ul>
      <br></br>
