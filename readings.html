  <h3>Reading Assignment #1 </h3>
  <p>Chapter 1</p>
  <p>1. Summarize the distinction(s) from the traditional Klines & Clines definition of the cyborg vs. the one that Clark is proposing as the main thesis of his book</p>

  <ul>Clark suggests we are natural-born cyborgs and we don’t need to have characteristics of a machine to be categorized as one, as we can have machines as an annex to our physical bodies. For example, our iPhones track a lot of our activities such
    as steps taken, screen time, location, etc. In addition, we have grown accustomed to using our smartphones to help us with our businesses. Technology doesn’t necessarily have to be implanted in our skin to be considered cyborgs.
    In contrast, Cline and Kline’s definition of a cyborg is an extension of humans and a cyborgs are machines and humans merging together as one.</ul>
  <br></br>

  <p>2. From The book, "Cyberneticists were especially interested in self-regulating systems." What are 2 or more examples of these, make sure to include both biological systems and also non-biological systems.
  </p>
  <ul>An example of a biological system in the human body system where every part has a role and x purpose. An example of a non-biological system is a computer where it uses programs to be able to operate.
  </ul>

  <br></br>

  <p>3. What other kinds of definitions of hybrid humans are there that are not based on definitions above but popular in literature, media culture, etc.: Dr. Octopus from the Spiderman.
  </p>

  <ul>Dr. Octopus from the movie Spiderman.</ul>

  <br></br>

  <p>Chapter 2</p>


  <p>1. Summarize a definition as described in the book of what the significant attributes  are for 'opaque' technology vs.   'transparent' technology.</p>

  <ul>“Transparent” technology is the type of technology that is so coherent in our lives and seem like a second nature for us to use that it almost blends seamlessly in our lifestyles. “Opaque” technology has a learning curve and requires skill
    which makes the particular technology to appear more obvious.
  </ul>
  <br></br>

  <p>2. Give some examples of technology that might be better served if it were more transparent and and also give some example of a technology that should be more opaque.
  </p>

  <ul>An example of a “transparent” technology is driving a car. Some example of an “opaque” technology is using an Instant Pot, high end coffee machine, or an expensive bidet.
  </ul>
  <br></br>

  <p>3.Does the watch and dictionary example discussed in the book, seem valid to you? Why?</p>

  <ul>Yes. Telling time through a watch is more accessible because it is more visible as supposed to searching for an unfamiliar word in a dictionary; either from a physical book or an application. </p>
  </ul>

  <h3>Reading Assignment #2 </h3>

  <p>Chapter 3</p>

<p>  Q1.Related to the text descriptions of how our senses work with our brain, explain your experiences where your senses have momentarily misled you or someone you know.
  Give examples of this.</p>

  <ul>An example of how my brain misled me was when the times I wasn’t wearing my eyeglasses. There were occasions when I see silhouettes and made me feel like something was there when there wasn’t. I once saw a silhouette of a lady’s face looking at me from a far, but I found out it was just tree branches. </ul>

  <p> Q2. What does the 'The Early Adopters Dream Technology' example on page 80 and the mangrove analogy starting on page 81 say about the role of language and its relationship to thought and meaning. Do you agree with the Authors assertions. Whether you agree or not, please explain why.</p>

  <ul>The initial vision of “The Early Adopters Dream Technology” was to create an intuitive resource of knowledge which humans can easily access and share. It would allow our minds to systematically process information and therefore makes us think faster. However, the downside was if the brain muscles are to rely on stored datas, it would make our brains stagnant therefore not be able to evolve through critical and creative thinking.
I do agree on both points if there is an equilibrium between the two. There are instances that we can benefit from a quick and accessible information (as we depend on Siri on or Alexa for example answers); however, the mind has to constantly evolve, adapt, critically think, reason, create and so forth, to continue living. I find brain muscles stretching as I play a Rubik’s cube or by simply reading.
The analogy of the mangrove claims that the language precedes knowledge, as the mangroves precedes the islands. I agree with this argument as I observe my 2 1/2” year old bilingual son construct complex sentences everyday. As he discovers his world around him, the words that he utters become a foundation of his cognitive development.</ul>

  <p> Q3. The Ideas of 'meta learning' (page 67) and constructive learning (page 83) are brought up in this chapter. What do these 2 ideas have in common in terms of the process of learning and using information and memory. Please eloborate your thoughts on how you can 'learn' something from this.</p>

  <ul>Both meta-learning and constructive learning describe the fluidity of the brain in adapting and expanding as it process new information or knowledge. The base knowledge or memory makes room for new information or skill and reconstruct to store new data which leads to further evolvement and development of the brain.</ul>

  <br></br>

  <p>Chapter 4</p>
  <br></br>
  <p>Chapter 4 -- First summarize the major elements of this chapter for yourself, and write them out in essay form.</p>
<ul>In summary, Chapter 4 Where Are We? elaborates the idea of the brain’s boundaries and perception as the extension or auxiliary to our physical locations. Our mind doesn’t need to be where the physical body is. Human brains have the capacity to have a telepresence in a different, distant, or virtual location. You can be anywhere where your mind is. That is the concept of this chapter.</ul>


    <p>Q1. What are the 2 main components of action discussed in the book, that is required for Telepresence to exist and function properly?  </p>

      <ul>The 2 components of action is the shifting or the “flipping back and forth” between the local and distant locations or the connection between the physical and the multi-sensory virtual representation.</ul>

    <p>Q2. What form of Telepresence do you think you have experienced? If you have not. What was the closest to it, and what was missing for it to be not be telepresence?  </p>

  <ul>The closest telepresence experience I had was the ride at Disneyland’s “Soarin’.” In this ride, we were buckled and suspended on the air as in we were riding in an air craft. The surroundings are dark, and there was a bigger-than-life screen in front of us. A video beautiful landscapes being seen from above was being played while we were experiencing different sensory stimulations to make the experience more realistic, as if we were flying over those landscapes. There were wind effects, mist spraying on our faces, scents of meadows, sounds of crashing waves and birds, and our seats rotating and swinging in the rhythm of the wind and music. The moment our seats were lifted and the video on the large screen started playing, I was transported to those landscapes and I truly felt like soaring high. What was missing was the experience to control anything. I was teleported in the virtual, but I wasn’t contributing much or doing anything to be a part of the situation. </ul>

    <p>Q3. Speculate on what other mechanics and sensory modalities that are based on Telepresence ideas, might be possible. What other ways can we be 'displaced' in their perception of where they are and what they can do.  </p>
