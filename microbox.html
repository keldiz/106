  <p>Artist Statement
<br> This is a very fulfilling project for me. I never thought I'd be able to build a music box from scratch.
<br> I've built many different boxes but never something with electronics. At first it was challenging for me
<br> to use the arduino software and hack the different tones. When I figured it out, it was really enjoyable
<br> changing the beat, tempo, and playing classic tones, making it my own. This was an amazing experience
<br> for me.
