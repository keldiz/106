  <h3>Phase 1 -- Using Processing and Serial (or Arduino and Processing with Serial to create a sample hardware interfaces for laptops)</h3>
  <br></br>
  <p>Artist Statement</p>
  <p>This is the first time I've used Processing. Together with the Serial Library, I was able to explore how to communicate with my computer using different functions and commands.
    I used Processing to play with Dimmer and Graph. With Dimmer, I can use my mouse to manipulate the power of my LED. <br>
    For Graph, I can use my Analog Sensor to control the graph up and down. Learning both of these controls was very interesting and cool. <br> It made me realize that I can do a lot of things around me using this controls such as dimming the lights,
    turning the music up and down and so on. </p>

  <h3>Phase 2 -- Building Hardware and Testing Software</h3>
  <br></br>
  <p>Artist Statement</p>
  <p>The neopixel leds are fun to play with. They are much better than and much powerful than a regular led. <br> Seeing these things change in color reminds me of watching Christmas lights during the holidays. <br> The only part that wasn't very enjoyable was soldering them together. Nobody should have to go through something like this.</p>

  <h3>Phase 3 -- Making 2 multi-value Serial Interface with your Microbox</h3>
  <br></br>
  <p>Artist Statement</p>
    <p>Adding a serial interface to my microbox added a different dimension to my device. <br> The animating neopixels made the device playful and fun. <br> Learning how to manipulate the leds using different codes is much more fulfilling.</p>
